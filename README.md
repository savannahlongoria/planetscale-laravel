# Build a CRUD Web Application From Scratch Using Laravel & PlanetScale
## Prerequisites:
* Beginner Laravel knowledge
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) â€” This tutorial uses v7.4~
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) 
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* A Free [PlanetScale account](https://auth.planetscale.com/sign-up)

## Creating a Laravel Project
Go to your terminal and run the following command to build a Laravel project. 

*  `composer create-project laravel/laravel --prefer-dist laravel-planetscale-app`
* `cd laravel-planetscale-app`

## PlanetScale Setup 
Before you dive into the code, let's get your database set up. Head over to PlanetScale to [sign up for an account](https://planetscale.com/sign-up) if you haven't already.

* Once you create an account you will be prompted to create a new database:
Give it a name, select the region closest to you or your application, and click "Create database"

> Your database comes with one default branch, `main`. This branch is designated as a development branch to start, with the goal to move it to production after you make any necessary schema changes. Promote the `main` branch to production now, and then create a new branch, `dev`, for development. 

### Connect your database
You can connect your development database to your Laravel application in one of two ways: using the PlanetScale proxy or with a username and password. This tutorial will show you how to connect with a username and password, but you can use either option.

### Connect with username and password:
1. Back in your PlanetScale dashboard, click on the "Branches" tab of your database and select `dev`
2. Click the "Connect" button
3. Click "New password"
4. Select "Laravel" from the dropdown that's currently set to "General" - Make sure to copy the full set of credentials. You won't be able to see the password again when you leave the page. You can always generate a new one if you do forget to store it.

You should see something like this: 
```DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=xxxxxxxxxx.us-east-3.psdb.cloud
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel-mood-tracker
DB_USERNAME=xxxxxxxxxxx
DB_PASSWORD=pscale_pw_xxxxxx-xx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA=/etc/ssl/cert.pem
```

### In your local `laravel-planetscale-app` directory 

`nano` (MacOS) into .env & .env_example
Open the .env file and above and replace the `DB` section with the PlanetScale/Laravel code snippet from the step above. 

## Setting Up Migration and Model
We have created the database and configured the database by adding the credentials in the `.env` file. Now, we will set the migration by adding the data properties in the MySQL table. 

>By default Laravel generates THE following files:
> * timestamp__create_users_table.php
> * timestamp_create_password_resets_table.php
> * timestamp_create_failed_jobs_table.php

> If you are building directly from the Laravel Example App and not my git repo: To create a Model and Migration file to create the migrations for PlanetScale, run the following command `php artisan make:model Student -m`

In this directory, I created the migration files timestampxx_create_students_table.php with The up() function allows creating/updating tables, columns, and indexes & The down() function allows reversing an operation done by up method.

Now it's time to run the migrations. In your terminal in the Laravel project directory, run the following:
1. RUN `php artisan migrate`

Since you're connected to your PlanetScale database, these migrations are now live on your `dev` branch (or whatever you configured in your `.env` file)!

To confirm this, go to your PlanetScale dashboard, click on your database, click "Branches", select the dev branch, click "Schema", and click "Refresh schema". You should see the DDL for the following tables: 
* failed_jobs
* migrations
* password_resets
* personal_access_tokens
* students
* users

## Configure routes: 
In this directory, I added schema to routes/web.php file. 

Run the following command to create the various routes for our CRUD app:
`php artisan route:list`

You should see something like this : 
```+--------+-----------+-------------------------+------------------+------------------------------------------------+------------+
| Domain | Method    | URI                     | Name             | Action                                         | Middleware |
+--------+-----------+-------------------------+------------------+------------------------------------------------+------------+
|        | GET|HEAD  | /                       |                  | Closure                                        | web        |
|        | GET|HEAD  | api/user                |                  | Closure                                        | api        |
|        |           |                         |                  |                                                | auth:api   |
|        | GET|HEAD  | students                | students.index   | App\Http\Controllers\StudentController@index   | web        |
|        | POST      | students                | students.store   | App\Http\Controllers\StudentController@store   | web        |
|        | GET|HEAD  | students/create         | students.create  | App\Http\Controllers\StudentController@create  | web        |
|        | GET|HEAD  | students/{student}      | students.show    | App\Http\Controllers\StudentController@show    | web        |
|        | PUT|PATCH | students/{student}      | students.update  | App\Http\Controllers\StudentController@update  | web        |
|        | DELETE    | students/{student}      | students.destroy | App\Http\Controllers\StudentController@destroy | web        |
|        | GET|HEAD  | students/{student}/edit | students.edit    | App\Http\Controllers\StudentController@edit    | web        |
```

## Start the app in the browser by running the given below command:
1. RUN `php artisan serve`
* You might still see the Laravel Homepage and that is because we set up two different routes in this directory. 
2. Navigate to 
* Create Student: http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/create
* Students List: http://127.0.0.1:8000/students
